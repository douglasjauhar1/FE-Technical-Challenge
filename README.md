<p align='justify'>Narrative Story : This is my first time using the Vuejs library from javascript, before I used react js, and in structural terms it is not much different so I can work on this project well, on the first day I got this challenge I focused on working html and css for the display to fit with the design provided, the next day I did templating with vue and function according to reqruitment, my obstacle, I had to think again while maintaining the state in order to save in local storage so that when the page is refreshed, the page can stay fresh, finally I use vue persist state and goals! data can enter local storage so that its functionality is complete. thank you jakmall for the challenges and new knowledge that I got.</p>
